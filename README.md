I recently used Solidity to design and code [Gwin](https://coltonmilbrandt.gitbook.io/gwin/), a unique market launching AMM. Prior to that, as founder of [Rent Buddy Inc](https://coltonmilbrandt.gitbook.io/rent-buddy/), I secured over $150k in funding and led a team of 14 to successfully launch a pioneering all-in-one rental property management app. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and have extensive experience in project management including years of working effectively with remote teams. I am always eager to explore new opportunities.
