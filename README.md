ðŸ‘‹  Hey there! Iâ€™m [Colton Milbrandt](https://coltonmilbrandt.com/).

As a skilled blockchain developer with seven years of experience in finance and tech, I enjoy using my technical skills to drive ambitious projects to launch. With my expertise in Solidity, Javascript, and front-end development, I recently created [Gwin](https://coltonmilbrandt.gitbook.io/gwin/), a unique market launching AMM. Prior to that, as founder of [Rent Buddy Inc](https://coltonmilbrandt.gitbook.io/rent-buddy/), I secured over $100k in funding and led a team of 14 to successfully a pioneering all-in-one rental property management app. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and have extensive experience in project management including years of working effectively with remote teams. I am always eager to explore new opportunities and work on innovative projects that fully realize the potential of blockchain technology.
